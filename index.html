My Hobbies are fishing, video games, hanging with friends, family and laughing. Im 27 years old and have a dog named bear. He can be a handful but I love him to death. his favorite food is without a doubt pizza. Or wait, probably chicken... Ya know what, his favorite food is everything. He will eat it all lol. He loves chewing on sticks, taking walks and chasing rabbits. I'm looking forward to the possibility of being able to attend Prime Academy to further myself as an individual and also professionally.</p></div>
